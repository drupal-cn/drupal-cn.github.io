        <h2>A</h2>

        <h3>Ajax</h3>
        <p>A web technology used to exchange data with a server to dynamically update parts of a web page (for example,
            forms) without needing entire page reloads.</p>

        <h3>Alias</h3>
        <p>A user-friendly name to replace the internal <a href="#path">path</a> that the system assigns to a URL on the
            site. For example, you might assign an alias of <em>/about</em> to the About page on your site, to replace
            the internal path <em>/node/5</em>. This would give the page a URL of <em>http://example.com/about</em>
            instead of <em>http://example.com/node/5</em>. See <a href="/docs/user_guide/en/content-paths.html">Section&nbsp;5.1,
                “Concept: Paths, Aliases, and URLs”</a> for more information.</p>

        <h3>Anonymous</h3>
        <p>A person (<a href="#user">user</a>) interacting with the site who is not logged in. See <a
                href="/docs/user_guide/en/user-concept.html">Section&nbsp;7.1, “Concept: Users, Roles, and
            Permissions”</a> for more information.</p>

        <h2>B</h2>

        <h3>Block</h3>
        <p>A chunk of <a href="#content">content</a> (text, images, links, etc.) that can be displayed on a page of a
            site. Blocks are displayed in <a href="#region">regions</a>. See <a
                    href="/docs/user_guide/en/block-concept.html">Section&nbsp;8.1, “Concept: Blocks”</a> for more
            information.</p>

        <h3>Breakpoint</h3>
        <p>Breakpoints are used to separate the height or width of browser screens, printers, and other media output
            types into steps. A <a href="#responsive">responsive</a> site adjusts its presentation at these breakpoints.
            See <a href="/docs/user_guide/en/structure-image-responsive.html">Section&nbsp;6.14, “Concept: Responsive

        <h3>Cache</h3>
        <p>The site’s internal cache stores the output of time-consuming calculations, such as computing output for an
            HTML page request, and then retrieves them instead of recalculating the next time they are needed. External
            caching systems can also be used on the web server to speed up a site’s response. See <a
                    href="/docs/user_guide/en/prevent-cache.html">Section&nbsp;12.1, “Concept: Cache”</a> for more

            more information.</p>

        <h3>Content item</h3>
        <p>An item of <a href="#content">content</a> that is typically meant to be displayed as the main content of a
            page on your site. This is an <a href="#entity-type">entity type</a>. See <a

                “Concept: Administrative Overview”</a> for more information.</p>

        <h3>Contributed</h3>
        <p><a href="#module">Modules</a>, <a href="#theme">themes</a>, and <a href="#distribution">distributions</a>
            that are not part of the <a href="#drupal-core">Drupal core</a> download, and that can be downloaded
            separately from the <a class="ulink" href="https://www.drupal.org" target="_top"><em>Drupal.org</em></a>
            website.</p>

        <h3>Cron</h3>
        <p>On some operating systems, <em>cron</em> is a command scheduler application that executes commands or scripts
            periodically. Your site defines periodic tasks, also known as cron tasks, that need to be triggered either
            by an operating system cron scheduler, or internally. See <a
                    href="/docs/user_guide/en/security-cron-concept.html">Section&nbsp;13.1, “Concept: Cron”</a> for

            Management System”</a> for more information.</p>

        <h2>E</h2>

        <h3>Entity</h3>
        <p>An item of either <a href="#content">content</a> or <a href="#configuration">configuration</a> data, although
            in common usage, the term often refers to content entities. Examples include <a href="#content-item">content
                items</a>, custom <a href="#block">blocks</a>, <a href="#taxonomy-term">taxonomy terms</a>, and
            definitions of <a href="#content-type">content types</a>; the first three are content entities, and the last
            is a configuration entity. See also <a href="#entity-type">Entity type</a>, <a href="#entity-subtype">Entity
                subtype</a>, and <a href="#field">Field</a>. See <a href="/docs/user_guide/en/planning-data-types.html">Section&nbsp;2.3,

            description, and a <a href="#taxonomy-term">taxonomy term</a>. See <a
                    href="/docs/user_guide/en/planning-data-types.html">Section&nbsp;2.3, “Concept: Content Entities and
                Fields”</a> for more information.</p>

            update</a>. See <a href="/docs/user_guide/en/security-concept.html">Section&nbsp;13.3, “Concept: Security
            and Regular Updates”</a> for more information.</p>

        <h3>User</h3>
        <p>A person interacting with the site, either logged-in or <a href="#anonymous">anonymous</a>. See <a
                href="/docs/user_guide/en/user-concept.html">Section&nbsp;7.1, “Concept: Users, Roles, and
            Permissions”</a> for more information.</p>

        <h3>User interface</h3>
        <p>The text, styles, and images that are visible on a site, separated logically into the user interface for site
            visitors and the administrative user interface.</p>

        <h3>User one (User 1)</h3>
        <p>The initial <a href="#user">user</a> account that is created when you install the site (whose ID number is
            1). It automatically has all <a href="#permission">permissions</a>, even if it is not assigned an
            administrative <a href="#role">role</a>. See <a href="/docs/user_guide/en/user-admin-account.html">Section&nbsp;7.2,
                “Concept: The User 1 Account”</a> for more information.</p>

        <h2>V</h2>

        <h3>View</h3>
        <p>A formatted listing of data; typically, the data comes from <a href="#content">content</a> <a href="#entity">entities</a>.
            For example, on a farmers market site, you might create a <a href="#content-item">content item</a> for each
            vendor. You could then make view that generates a listing page that shows a thumbnail image and short
            description of each vendor, linking to the full-page content item. Using the same data, you could also make
            a view that generates a new vendors block, which would show information from the most recently added
            vendors. See <a href="/docs/user_guide/en/planning-modular.html">Section&nbsp;2.4, “Concept: Modular
                Content”</a> for more information.</p>

        <h3>View mode</h3>
        <p>A set of <a href="#field-formatter">field formatter</a> <a href="#configuration">configuration</a> for all of
            the <a href="#field">fields</a> of a <a href="#content">content</a> <a href="#entity">entity</a>, some of
            which may be hidden. Each <a href="#entity-subtype">entity subtype</a> can have one or more view modes
            defined; for example, <a href="#content-type">content types</a> typically have <em>Full</em> and
            <em>Teaser</em> view modes, where the <em>Teaser</em> view mode displays fewer or trimmed-down fields. See
            <a href="/docs/user_guide/en/structure-view-modes.html">Section&nbsp;6.10, “Concept: View Modes and
                Formatters”</a> for more information.</p>

        <h3>Vocabulary</h3>
        <p>A group of <a href="#taxonomy-term">taxonomy terms</a> to choose from when classifying <a href="#content">content</a>
            in a particular way, such as the list of all of the vendor categories on a farmers market site. Technically,
            vocabularies are the <a href="#entity-subtype">entity subtype</a> for the taxonomy term <a
                    href="#entity-type">entity type</a>. See <a href="/docs/user_guide/en/structure-taxonomy.html">Section&nbsp;6.5,
                “Concept: Taxonomy”</a> for more information.</p>

        <h2>W</h2>

        <h3>Widget</h3>
        <p>See <a href="#field-widget">Field widget</a>.</p>

        <h3>Wizard</h3>
        <p>A web form that allows you to fill in a few values, and creates something with sensible defaults based on the
            values you chose. For example, there are wizards for creating <a href="#view">views</a> of different types.
            See <a href="/docs/user_guide/en/views-create.html">Section&nbsp;9.3, “Creating a Content List View”</a> for
            more information.</p>

        <h3>WYSIWYG</h3>
        <p>Acronym for <em>What You See is What You Get</em>, meaning a method for editing <a
                href="#content">content</a> where what you see on the editing screen closely resembles the final
            product. See <a href="/docs/user_guide/en/structure-text-format-config.html">Section&nbsp;6.16, “Configuring
                Text Formats and Editors”</a> for more information.</p></article>
